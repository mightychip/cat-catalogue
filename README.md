# Cat Catalogue
This is a simple Spring Boot application which will be built up over a series of branches.  Each branch will equate to a single lesson/presentation/"Lunch 'n Learn" and will be paired with a presentation.

Presentations will be provided in Keynote and PDF format, with extra presenter's notes found in the Keynote file.

This application serves up information about cats via a REST API.  This serves as a back-end to a cats-only high-end veterinary clinic and will be updated over the lessons with features appropriate to its use.
