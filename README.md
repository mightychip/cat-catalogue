# Cat Catalogue
This is a simple Spring Boot application which will be built up over a series of branches.  Each branch will equate to a single lesson/presentation/"Lunch 'n Learn" and will be paired with a presentation.

Presentations will be provided in Keynote and PDF format, with extra presenter's notes found in the Keynote file.

This application serves up information about cats via a REST API.  This serves as a back-end to a fictitious cats-only high-end veterinary clinic and will be updated over the lessons with features appropriate to its use.

## Lessons
#### Lesson 1 - Spring Boot Basics
In this lesson, we delve into the basics of Spring and Spring Boot.  The focus here is mainly on embedded containers and useful Spring Boot features designed to speed along prototype development.  At the end of this lesson, we'll have created a REST API to serve up some basic information about cats at our fictitious clinic.
